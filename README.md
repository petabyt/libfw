# LibUI Touch
This is a UI library compatible with [libui](https://github.com/libui-ng/libui-ng) that can be run on iOS and Android.  
Unlike React Native, this exposes C functions that can be called by any of the languages [LibUI has bindings for](https://github.com/libui-ng/libui-ng#user-content-language-bindings)  

Demo app: https://github.com/petabyt/us
